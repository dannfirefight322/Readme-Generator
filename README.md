This is a program that will help developers generate a readme file with all the important information one would need in a matter of seconds.
I used node.js and javascript to build the program.
The main thing powering this program is the use of Inquirer.
1. To use a devloper would have to clone this repo down to their local machine.
2. Once it has been cloned down, they would open the folder in VS code and open a terminal while in the index.js file.(do this by right clicking on index.js and by clicking "Open in Intergrated Terminal).
3. Once a terminal is opened run the command node index.js and press enter.
4. You will then be taken through a series of prompts that will ask you questions pretaining to the project that will be included in the readme file.
5. At the end of the prompts you will get a prompt "readme generated" and if you look into the files off to the right hand side of the screen while in VS code and new readme file will now be generated.
If you open the readme file you will see all the information you input in a nicely formatted readme file.
